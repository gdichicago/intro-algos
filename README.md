# Algorithms 101

## Course Description

**What's an algorithm?** Besides being the answer to most interview questions, an algorithm is a way to solve a particular problem in programming. 

Google Maps uses an algorithm to calculate driving directions through 3 cities while avoiding highways. Amazon uses an algorithm to figure out exactly what product to recommend to you next so that you'll blindly one-click it. 

In this workshop, we will discuss what an algorithm is, introduce the idea of algorithmic complexity (big O notation), demonstrate sort and search algorithms (with a hands-on re-enactment), and finish with an overview of the many types of algorithms out there. 

This workshop focuses on design-thinking for algorithms, which is a pre-requisite to expressing these ideas in code.


### Prerequisites

Attendees would benefit from a basic understanding of a programming language, like from JS 101, but that is not required.


### Tech requirements:

â€¢ Your laptop, if you'd like to follow along with the slides. 

### Topics covered:
* Big O notation
* Hands-on re-enactment of sort and search
